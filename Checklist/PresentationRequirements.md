# Presentation Requirements

The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows:

Each presentation must:

* [ ] Be 8–10 minutes in length (check with the instructor for the official presentation time).

* [ ] Describe the project's core message or hypothesis.

* [ ] Describe the questions the group found of interest, and why.

* [ ] Summarize how, and where, the data was found to answer these questions.

* [ ] Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by Jupyter Notebook).

* [ ] Describe the analysis process (accompanied by Jupyter Notebook).

* [ ] Summarize the conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did the analysis produce), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data).

* [ ] Discuss the implications of the findings (which shall take the form of an open-ended discussion about what the findings mean).

* [ ] Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
