# Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows:

* [ ] Use Pandas to clean and format all dataset(s).

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process.

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**.

* [ ] Use PyViz, Panel, Plotly Express, and Hvplot to create six to eight data visualizations (ideally, at least two per question asked of the data), and aggregate these visualizations into a dashboard.

* [ ] Save PNG images of the visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, as well as for the presentation, and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.

* [ ] Optional: Use at least one API, if an API can be found with data pertinent to your primary research questions.

* [ ] Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each question that was asked of your data, with a short description of what you found and any relevant plots under each heading.
